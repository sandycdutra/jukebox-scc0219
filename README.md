## Comments About the Code
The HTML structure is organized hierarchically, dividing the website into main sections (header, content, footer). The header and footer are shared between all the pages. For the home page, we added two sections, a "what's new" section that is comprised of a carrousel to show new realeses, and a "products" section, where we display all products. The products are organized in a grid. For the Vinyl, CD and Accessories page, we created a similar grid to the home page, and we created a sidebar where we can choose which genre we want to browse. For the register page, we created a form where the user introduces their information.

## Test Plan
*Planned approach:*
- **Backend**: Postman tests for API routes (users, products)
- **Frontend**: Jest unit tests for React components
- **Integration**: Manual testing of checkout flow
- **User login**: frontend/src/mockdata/users.jsx

---

## Test Results
*Will include:*
- Pass/fail rates for critical user journeys
- Screenshots of test executions
